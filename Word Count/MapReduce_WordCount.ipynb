Prior to the last half of a decade or so, most of football analytics was confined to\\n', 'a few seminal pieces of work. Arguably the earliest example of analytics being used in\\n', 'football occurred when former Brigham Young University, Chicago Bears, Cincinnati\\n', 'Bengals, and San Diego Chargers quarterback Virgil Carter created the notion of an\\n', 'expected point as coauthor of the 1971 paper “Technical Note: Operations Research in\\n', 'Football” before he teamed with the legendary Bill Walsh as the first quarterback to\\n', 'execute what is now known as the West Coast offense.\\n', 'The idea of an expected point is incredibly important in football, as the game by its\\n', 'very nature is discrete: a collection of a finite number of plays (also called downs) that\\n', 'require the offense to go a certain distance (in yards) before having to surrender the\\n', 'ball to the opposing team. If the line to gain is the opponent’s end zone, the offense\\n', 'scores a touchdown, which is worth, on average, seven points after a post-touchdown\\n', 'conversion. Hence, the expected point provides an estimated, or expected value for the\\n', 'number of points you would expect a team to score given the current game situation\\n', 'on that drive.\\n', 'Football  statistics  have  largely  been  confined  to  offensive  players,  and  have  been\\n', 'doled out in the currency of yards gained and touchdowns scored. The problem with\\n', 'this is obvious. If a player catches a pass to gain 7 yards, but 8 are required to get\\n', 'a first down or a touchdown, the player did not gain a first down. Conversely, if a\\n', 'player  gains  5  yards,  when  5  are  required  to  get  a  first  down  or  a  touchdown,  the\\n', 'player gained a first down. Hence, “enough” yards can be better than “more” yards\\n', 'depending on the context of the play. As a second example, if it takes a team two plays\\n', 'to travel 70 yards to score a touchdown, with one player gaining the first 65 yards and\\n', '1\\n', 'the second gaining the final 5, why should the second player get all the credit for the\\n', 'score?\\n', 'In  1988,  Bob  Carroll,  Pete  Palmer,  and  John  Thorn  wrote  The  Hidden  Game  of\\n', 'Football (Grand Central Publishing), which further explored the notions of expected\\n', 'points. In 2007, Brian Burke, who was a US Navy pilot before creating the Advanced\\n', 'Football  Analytics  website  (http://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com),  formulated\\n', 'the expected-points and expected-points-added approach, along with building a win\\n', 'probability model responsible for some key insights, including the 4th Down Bot at\\n', 'the  New  York  Times  website.  Players  may  be  evaluated  by  the  number  of  expected\\n', 'points or win probability points added to their teams when those players did things\\n', 'like throw or catch passes, run the ball, or sack the quarterback.\\n', 'The work of Burke inspired the open source work of Ron Yurko, Sam Ventura, and\\n', 'Max Horowitz of Carnegie Mellon University. The trio built nflscrapR, an R package\\n', 'that  scraped  NFL  play-by-play  data.  The  nflscrapR  package  was  built  to  display\\n', 'their own versions of expected points added (EPA) and win probability (WP) models.\\n', 'Using this framework, they also replicated the famous wins above replacement (WAR)\\n', 'framework from baseball for quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers, which\\n', 'was published in 2018. This work was later extended using different data and meth‐\\n', 'ods by Eric and his collaborator George Chahouri in 2020. Eric’s version of WAR, and\\n', 'its analogous model for college football, are used throughout the industry to this day.\\n', 'The  nflscrapR package served as a catalyst for the popularization of modern tools\\n', 'that use data to study football, most of which use a framework that will be replicated\\n', 'constantly  throughout  this  book.  The  process  of  building  an  expectation  for  an\\n', 'outcome—in  the  form  of  points,  completion  percentage,  rushing  yards,  draft-pick\\n', 'outcome, and many more—and measuring players or teams via the residual (that is,\\n', 'the difference between the value expected by the model and the observed value) is a\\n', 'process that transcends football. In soccer, for example, expected goals (xG) are the\\n', 'cornerstone metric upon which players and clubs are measured in the sport known\\n', 'as “the Beautiful Game”. And shot quality—the expected rate at which a shot is made\\n', 'in basketball—is a ubiquitous measure for players and teams on the hardwood. The\\n', 'features that go into these models, and the forms that they take, are the subject of\\n', 'constant research whose surface we will scratch in this book.\\n', 'The rise of tools like  nflscrapR allowed more people to show their analytical skills\\n', 'and flourish in the public sphere. Analysts were hired based on their tweets on Twit‐\\n', 'ter because of their ingenious approaches to measuring team performance.
